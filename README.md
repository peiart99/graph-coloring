## A University Project for Combinatorial Optimization class
### The code in the current _main_ branch handles reading graphs from a file as well as generating random graphs. The coloring algorithms are being worked on on the _development_ branch.
The goal of the project is to explore solutions to the **Graph Coloring Problem**.

The fist algorithm that will be implemented is the greedy algorithm. After that the task is to implement a chosen **metaheuristic** and compare it's efficiency to the previously mentioned greedy algorithm.

The enforced format for graph instances:
```
5
1 2
1 5
2 1
2 3
3 2
3 4
4 3
4 5
```
The first line represents the number of vertices. All of the lines after that represent the connections between 2 vertices.
